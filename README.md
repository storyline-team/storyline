# Storyline: Collaborative NFT Writing

ðŸš§ In Progress ðŸš§ 

Storyline is a blockchain based writing platform, where users come together to collectively write a story for the world to see. When a user visits our site, they can read the full Storyline so far, from start to finish, on the homepage. In addition, users will have the option to add new content to the Storyline (which gets minted as an NFT), at a small Ether writing fee. If their writing gets published to the blockchain, then the platform will display their addition at the very end of the story, appended to the rest of it.
